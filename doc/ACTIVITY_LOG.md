# Activity log


Fireflutter uses Firestore to save the activity logs.

It was first implemented with RTDB and it was working fine. But it was more complicated and difficult to manage when it is built with RTDB. So, we replaced RTDB with firestore. Using firestore may cause a bit more but we thought it would be more beneficial for management.
