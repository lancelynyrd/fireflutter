## Overview

The goal of FireFlutter is to provide the reusable common code blocks encapsulating in the widgets. So, developer can quickly develop what they want using this package.

It provides code for user, forum, chat and push notificiation management that works with `like`, `favorite`, `follow`, `post` and `comment` features.

There are some pre-defined fields for the common usage in the database structure. We use `json_serializable` for providing each model with the fields.

The model has also basic CRUD functionalities.
