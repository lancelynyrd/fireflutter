## Translation

I feel like the standard i18n feature is a bit heavy and searched for other i18n packages. And I decided to write a simple i18n code for fireflutter.

The i18n code is in `lib/i18n/t.dart`.

By default, it supports English and you can change it to any language.

Here is an example of updating the translation.

```dart
tr.user.loginFirst = '로그인을 해 주세요.';
```
