# Theme Design

## Test Theme

- `labelSmall` is set to 10, small enough for a label but may be difficult to read. It is used for various labels.
    - Example usage:
        - Time in chat room messages
        - Names in chat room messages
- `labelMedium` is around 12, which is a suitable size but still small.
    - Example usage:
        - labelLarge is around 14, which is a suitable size.
- `bodyMedium` is used for general text display/reading and is the default size for displaying text using the `Text` widget in Flutter.
    - Example usage:
        - Posts, comment texts, UserDisplayName, etc.
