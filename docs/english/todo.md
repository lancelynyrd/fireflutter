# TODO

- Count(stat) no of users, posts (per category), comments (per category)
- Log histories (all user activities)
- Feed
- Image deletion.
  - If user closes app (or what so ever), the image is left as garbage.
  - To handle this, when an image is being uploaded and attached to a post/comment/user/whatever, we need to save a meta data on the image in storage. So, the garbage will not have that meta data. And then, we can put a menu in admin screen to list all the garbages and delete them.


- Save `noOfUsers` in each chat room. So, it can display how many users in the room anywhere in the app.
